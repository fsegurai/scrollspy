# 🎢 ScrollSpy Playground Sample

Welcome to the playground! Scroll around and watch the navigation glow like a disco floor on a Saturday night. 💃🕺

---

# Introduction

Hey there! This playground is designed to push ScrollSpy to its limits.  
Scroll through the sections, nested content, and funny notes, and see how the TOC stays perfectly in sync — no matter how wild the ride!

---

# Chapter 1 - The Basics

## Section 1.1 - Hello World

Let’s start simple: scrollspy tracks the section currently in view and highlights the corresponding nav link.

Did you know?  
*Scrolling* is like teleportation — but slower.

---

## Section 1.2 - Why ScrollSpy?

Because no one likes to get lost on a page!  
ScrollSpy keeps your navigation alive and kicking.

---

# Chapter 2 - Advanced Techniques

Welcome to the deeper end of the pool. 🏊‍♀️

---

## Section 2.1 - Nested Navigation

This section shows nested navigation support:

- Parent item gets highlighted when any child is active.
- Smooth behavior for complex TOCs.

Scroll down slowly to watch the magic.

---

## Section 2.2 - Dynamic Offset

Adjust the scroll offset to handle fixed headers or sticky navbars.

---

## Section 2.3 - Edge Cases

What if two sections overlap or the page ends?

ScrollSpy handles those gracefully (we hope).

---

# Chapter 3 - Fun with ScrollSpy

## Section 3.1 - Easter Eggs

If you spot any bugs, they're *undocumented features*. 😎

---

## Section 3.2 - Party Mode

Imagine if scrollspy triggered confetti every time you reach a new section. 🎉

(Pssst… maybe you should add that yourself!)

---

# Chapter 4 - The Final Frontier

Last chapter, but not least.

Keep scrolling — you’re almost there!

---

# Conclusion

Thanks for visiting the ScrollSpy playground!

Now go forth and build amazing docs, blogs, or websites —  
and never let your users get lost in the scroll abyss again.

# Huge Section for Scroll Testing

The Tale of ScrollSpy: The Navigator's Best Friend

Once upon a time, in the vast lands of the Internet, users wandered through endless pages, lost in the wilderness of long content and sprawling documents. They clicked and scrolled, but their navigation menus lay silent, never telling them where they were or where to go next.

Enter ScrollSpy, the vigilant guardian of the navigation realm. Born from the need to keep explorers oriented, ScrollSpy watched the user’s scroll position like a lighthouse keeper watches the sea. With every flick of the wheel or swipe of the finger, ScrollSpy lit up the correct path in the navigation, guiding travelers safely through nested forests of headings and vast deserts of paragraphs.

No longer did users stumble or get confused. With ScrollSpy’s watchful eye, the active section was always highlighted — a friendly beacon shining bright — making the journey smooth, intuitive, and delightful.

And so, ScrollSpy became the navigator’s best friend, silently working behind the scenes, ensuring no one ever got lost again in the endless scroll.
